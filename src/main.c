    /* SETUP FUNCTIONS
     *
     * There are three ways to initialise wiringPi.
     *
     *  * int wiringPiSetup (void) ;
     *  * int wiringPiSetupGpio (void) ;
     *  * int wiringPiSetupSys (void) ;
     *
     * One of the setup functions must be called at the start of your program. If it returns -1 then the initialisation
     * of the GPIO has failed, and you should consult the global errno to see why.
     *
     * The differences between the setup functions are as follows:
     *  * wiringPiSetup(void) ;
     *    This initialises the wiringPi system and assumes that the calling program is going to be using the wiringPi
     *    pin numbering scheme. This is a simplified numbering scheme which provides a mapping from virtual pin numbers
     *    0 through 16 to the real underlying Broadcom GPIO pin numbers. See the pins page for a table which maps the
     *    wiringPi pin number to the Broadcom GPIO pin number to the physical location on the edge connector.
     *
     *    This function needs to be called with root privileges.
     *
     *  * wiringPiSetupGpio(void) ;
     *    This is identical to above, however it allows the calling programs to use the Broadcom GPIO pin numbers
     *    directly with no re-mapping.
     *
     *    As above, this function need to be called with root priveledges
     *
     *  * wiringPiSetupSys(void)
     *    This initialises the wiringPi system but uses the /sys/class/gpio interface rather than accessing the hardware
     *    directly. This can be called as a non-root user provided the GPIO pins have been exported before-hand using
     *    the gpio program. Pin number in this mode is the native Broadcom GPIO numbers.
     *
     *    Note: In this mode you can only use the pins which have been exported via the /sys/class/gpio interface. You
     *    must export these pins before you call your program. You can do this in a separate shell-script, or by using
     *    the system() function from inside your program.
     *
     *    Also note that some functions (noted below) have no effect when using this mode as theyâ€™re not currently
     *    possible to action unless called with root privileges.
     */
    wiringPiSetupGpio();


    /* void pinMode (int pin, int mode) ;
     * This sets the mode of a pin to either INPUT, OUTPUT, or PWM_OUTPUT. Note that only wiringPi pin 1 (BCM_GPIO 18)
     * supports PWM output. The pin number is the number obtained from the pins table.
     *
     * This function has no effect when in Sys mode.
